To ensure high-quality, maintainable Dynamics 365 solutions, we use structured checklists for code and Power Automate flow reviews.

| Checklist | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [🧠 Code Review](.github/checklists/CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) | Plugin architecture, TypeScript web resources, query safety, testing, and documentation |
| [🔁 Flow Review](.github/checklists/FLOW_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md) | Trigger scope, error handling, environment awareness, and integration with plugins |

> These checklists are used during pull request reviews and are referenced in our [PR template](.github/pull_request_template.md).
